Hello!
My name is Rohit Satish and this was one fo the projects I did while in the lab of Dr. Debraj Mukherjee fro the Johns Hopkins Hospital.

PREMISE
The National Cancer Database is a dataset made by the American College of Surgeons that keeps tracks of over 100 clincial, demographic, ethnic,
and socioeconomic facotrs attributed to patinets treated for certainn diseases in the target of data subsets. This project specifically focused
on the NCDB Meningiona Data Set for which I conducted data analysis in R across about 20 factors to see if a care disparity or mortality
difference existed in groups segregated by the aforementioned factors.

This project contains a few things:

1. This README file of course
2. A workflow I used to create the outline of how my code would be laid out when conducting data analysis in the form of the PRISMA diagram
3. The code in AcousticScript.R which was used as a statistical basis to develop my code
4. The NCDB Data Dictionary so that picked data values in the future code can be referenced for thir applicable field/attributes.
5. My MeningiomaScript.R script with an associated example output in Tumor Grade Analysis.png
6. The ComparisonsOfInterest.R script which hones in on the specific comarisons doen in MeningiomaScript.R that produced a statistically significant p-value
7. The associated Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Academic vs Non-Academic group (an identified comparison of interest) which models mortality vs time for observed groups

I would like to thank Dr. Debraj Mukherjee and Dr. Julian Gendreau for their help and support thorugh this projecta and I would liek to thank future Dr. Sachiv Chakravarti for his mentorship as I learned thorugh this project about neuro-oncological surgery outcomes and ho the field of computer science can mesh with it.
